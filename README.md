# 🧪 QA Test Repository: Automation Exercise & OpenCart Integration  
**Group 4 – Quality Assurance Project**  
*Target Completion: November 27, 2025*

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains all test artifacts for the **Quality Assurance initiative** covering two web applications:

- **[Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/)** – UI, API, and functional testing  
- **[OpenCart Demo](https://demo.opencart.com/)** – Database integrity and schema validation  

The project follows an **Agile sprint methodology** with a focus on comprehensive test coverage across UI, API, and database layers.

## ✅ Current Status (As of October 30, 2025)

**Sprints 1 & 2 are complete.** All foundational planning and test design work has been delivered:

- ✅ **Test Plan** finalized and approved (`Test_Plan.pdf`)
- ✅ **UI Test Cases** template created (`UI test cases - Home.csv`)  
  *(Note: Test steps and details will be filled during execution in Sprint 3)*
- ✅ **API Test Cases** designed, executed, and documented (`APITestCases_updated - Sheet1.csv`)  
  - Includes 19 test scenarios covering product listing, search, user authentication, account management, and error handling
  - Results show both **PASSED** and **FAILED** cases, providing clear input for defect reporting

**Next: Sprint 3 (Oct 30 – Nov 7, 2025)** will focus on:
- Full **UI test execution** (manual + automation)
- **Defect logging** for failed API and UI tests
- **Database validation** for OpenCart using SQL scripts
- **Retesting** and validation of fixes
